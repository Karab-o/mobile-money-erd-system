Design Justification
Hybrid Relationship Model: The design employs both direct foreign keys (SenderID/ReceiverID in Transactions) and a junction table (Transaction_Participants) to balance performance with flexibility. Direct references enable fast queries for common two-party transactions, while the junction table accommodates complex scenarios involving agents, merchants, or multiple participants without sacrificing data integrity.
Normalization Strategy: Transaction_Categories is separated to eliminate redundancy and provide referential integrity. This allows easy addition of new transaction types without modifying existing transaction records, supporting business growth and regulatory changes common in mobile money systems.
Audit Trail Architecture: System_Logs maintains a comprehensive audit trail linked to transactions, crucial for regulatory compliance and dispute resolution. The LogType field categorizes different system events (OTP, errors, info), enabling efficient filtering and monitoring.
User Role Flexibility: The single Users table with UserType field supports customers, agents, and merchants without redundant schemas. This approach simplifies user management while maintaining role-specific functionality through application logic.
Transaction Integrity: Including BalanceAfter in the Transactions table creates a point-in-time balance snapshot, essential for reconciliation and preventing balance calculation errors due to concurrent transactions. The ExternalReference field accommodates integration with banks, USSD systems, and third-party services.
Scalability Considerations: The composite primary key in Transaction_Participants (TransactionID, UserID) ensures data integrity while supporting efficient queries. This design scales well for high-volume mobile money operations typical in emerging markets.
This architecture balances operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and future extensibility requirements essential for mobile financial services.
