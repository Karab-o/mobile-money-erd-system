AI Usage Log

Project: Mobile Money SMS System (MoMo)
Team Member:Karabo Divine

1. Purpose

This document logs all AI interactions performed during the development of the MoMo SMS System. It ensures compliance with prohibited AI use, transparency, and AI detection requirements.

2. Prohibited AI Use

During this project, the following AI activities were strictly avoided:

Generating ERD designs or SQL database schemas

Creating business logic or defining database relationships

Writing reflection content or technical explanations

All AI-assisted work remained limited to guidance, syntax clarification, and reviewing queries.

3. Transparency Requirements

All AI-assisted interactions followed these rules:

AI Usage Log: Maintained a detailed record of every AI interaction.

Attribution: All AI-assisted code sections were clearly marked within scripts.

Example:

-- AI-assisted code: Generated with Claude AI
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_sender ON Transactions(SenderID);

4. AI Detection Measures

To ensure work authenticity and prevent misuse:

Live sessions: Individual competency verified in team coding sessions.

Team-specific requirements: Generic AI solutions were not applied; all outputs were adapted to the teamâ€™s context.

Personal reflections: Written exclusively from first-hand experience.

Cross-referencing: Individual contributions were cross-checked against team deliverables to ensure originality.

5. AI Interaction Log
Tool Used	Purpose of Interaction	Output/Result	Attribution
Claude AI	Correct SQL syntax for Transactions table	Provided revised CREATE TABLE statement	Code 
TestSprit	Guidance on triggers and foreign keys	Suggested BEFORE INSERT trigger logic	Trigger code 
Claude AI	Index creation and performance optimization	Recommended CREATE INDEX statements	Code 
TestSprit	Verification queries for database	Provided queries to list tables and sample data	Query code 
6. Notes

No AI tools were used for ERD generation, defining database relationships, or personal reflections.

Claude AI and TestSprit were only used for syntax verification, query optimization suggestions, and general guidance, in strict compliance with project rules.

All AI-assisted outputs were reviewed, adapted, and integrated manually by team member.
